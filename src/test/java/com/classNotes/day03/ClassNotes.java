tags - to filter tests for the execution.
Q: How do you run specific tests / specific group of tests in your projects?
A:  1. We're using tags to group scenarios. We group them based on components, test suite
        F.e: @smaoke_test, @regression, @VYT_3433, @e2e

Same tags can be placed on as many as you want scenarios.

    2.   We're pointing on the specific sub folder or feature in the runner class:
